Project name: AAB Analysis
Description of the data: startup sellings food products log data (224126 rows 4 columns) for users belonging to 3 groups (two control groups(A) and test group B).
Task:   to investigate user behavior for the company's app and to evaluate effectiveness of new test fonts.
Libraries used: pandas, numpy, seaborn, plotly.express, plotly.graph_objects, math, scipy, sidetable, cufflinks.
Results: After the preprocessing and EDA the funnel analysis was conducted. I used proportion test to compare groups A, A and B. No statistically significant difference between control and test groups found, so new fonts didn't really influence user behavior.
