Project name: Bank Loans
Description of the data: 21525 bank loaners characterised with 14 parameters.
Task: to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division: to check the initial hypothesis that a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether he will default on a loan, to define customers' characteristics that influence their abilyty to return a loan.
Libraries used: pandas, sidetable, datetime.
Results: After data preprocessing I calculated debt rate and looked througt its relation with having children , marital status, income level, credit purpose. I approved the hypothesisis that castomer's ability to pay back on time is affected by his marital status and number of children, as well as by his income level and purpose of the loan.
Four debt scores were proposed for customer's characteristics and the total score ranging from -9 to +9, which can predict default risk of a customer.
