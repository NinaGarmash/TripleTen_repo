## #1 Project name: Bank Loans. Analyzing borrowers’ risk of defaulting

**Project description**

Your project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. You’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. Your report will be considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

**Instructions for completing the project**
* Step 1. Open the data file /datasets/credit_scoring_eng.csv and have a look at the general information.
* Step 2. Preprocess the data:
  
Identify and fill in missing values

Replace the real number data type with the integer type

Delete duplicate data

Categorize the data

The data may contain artifacts, or values that don't correspond to reality (for instance, a negative number of days employed). This kind of thing happens when you're working with real data. You need to describe the possible reasons such data may have turned up and process it.

* Step 3. Answer these questions:

Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?

Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?

Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?

How do different loan purposes affect on-time loan repayment?

Interpret your answers. Explain what the results you obtained mean.

* Step 4. Write an overall conclusion.

**Results:**
After data preprocessing I calculated debt rate and looked througt its relation with having children , marital status, income level, credit purpose. I approved the hypothesisis that castomer's ability to pay back on time is affected by his marital status and number of children, as well as by his income level and purpose of the loan.
Four debt scores were proposed for customer's characteristics and the total score ranging from -9 to +9, which can predict default risk of a customer.
