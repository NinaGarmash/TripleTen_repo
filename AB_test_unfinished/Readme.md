# Final Project_1.
## Unfinished A/B Test.

**Task:** to complete A/B test launched by predecessors and analyze its results.

**Description of the data:** testing changes related to the introduction of an improved recommendation system. A/B test was launched by analysts for an international online store. The purpose of the analysis is to examine the test data and see whether it was carried out correctly. Then, to analyze the results.

**Instructions on completing the task**
Upload the data and preprocess
Does it need converting types?
Are there any missing or duplicate values? If so, what's their nature?
Carry out exploratory data analysis
Study conversion at different funnel stages
Is the number of events per user distributed equally in the samples?
Are there users who enter both samples?
How is the number of events distributed by days?
Think of the possible details in the data that you have to take into account before starting the A/B test?
Evaluate the A/B test results
What can you tell about the A/B test results?
Use the z-criterion to check the statistical difference between the proportions
Describe the conclusions on the EDA stage, as well as on the evaluation of the A/B test results

**Libraries used:** pandas, numpy, datetime, seaborn, plotly.express, plotly.graph_objects, math, stats.

**Results:** I found numerous issues in A/B test organization and previous analysis and resolved them where possible.EDA was conducted, conclusions about converion are made.The A/B test results were evaluated as unreliable, to get clear and reliable results some recommendations to improve the test are given. But I doubt that there is any point in repeating the test and to check the effectiveness of the improved recommendation system, since we failed to find parameters by which group B would surpass group B or at least any positive tendency in comparison.
