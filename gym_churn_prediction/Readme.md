Project name: Gym Churn Prediction
Description of the data: Model Fitness  gym chain digitized customer profiles: 4000 customers characterized with 14 parameters
Task:  to analyze data and come up with a customer retention strategy.
Libraries used: pandas, numpy, datetime, seaborn, plotly.express, plotly.graph_objects, math, stats, sklearn (dendrogram, linkage), sklearn (StandardScaler, train_test_split, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier,accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, KMeans)
Results: the main differences between churned and non-churned users are found. Two models for binary classification were built to predict user churn: logistic regression and random forest. **Logistic regression** model gives better results and can be used for predicting user churn. The users were devided into 5 clusters, ordered by **churn rate** from the most loyal to the least loyal. Recommendations to prevent churn are given.
