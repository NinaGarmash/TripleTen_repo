database containing data on books, publishers, authors, and customer ratings and reviews of books.

**Tasks:** to give answers to 5 questions using SQL-queries.

2. Find the number of user reviews and the average rating for each book.

3. Identify the publisher that has released the greatest number of books with more than 50 pages (this will help you exclude brochures and similar publications from your analysis).

4. Identify the author with the highest average book rating (look only at books with at least 50 ratings).

5. Find the average number of text reviews among users who rated more than 50 books.
